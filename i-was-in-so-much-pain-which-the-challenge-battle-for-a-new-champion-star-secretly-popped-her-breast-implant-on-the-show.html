On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Challenge: Battle For a New Champion</strong></a> yesterday (February 7), history repeated itself when yet another belly-flop caused a breast implant to rupture, among other injuries.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>In an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, one of the challengers who was eliminated just shy of the finale spoke out about this less-than-ideal situation, admitting that although it was not shown on our television screens, she “was in so much pain” and “couldn’t even breathe.” How scary is that?</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Who was this victim exactly? Keep scrolling to find out for yourself…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Challenge_-Battle-for-a-New-Champion-Olivia.png><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 data-characters=476 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>Prefacing by saying that the daily challenge “was probably the most dangerous challenge” of the entirety of The Challenge: Battle For a New Champion — which required challengers to run on a rolling drum above water, holding onto a rope, and attempting to stay on the drum as long as possible — <strong>OIivia Kaiser </strong>admitted to Entertainment Weekly that she she suffered numerous injuries, including bursting one of her breast implants, during said challenge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7>“If your feet are still on the wheel, you’re going to fall face first. I broke three ribs and popped my implant, or ripped it, or ruptured it, so now I have to get my boobs redone. I was in so much pain. There was no way I could even have competed in the final. I couldn’t even breathe.”</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>While she did not burst any breast implants, Michele Fitzgerald spoke out about this oh-so dangerous challenge as well, admitting that she sustained broken ribs like Olivia.</p><p>“It f*****g hurt when I fell, and I broke two ribs… I genuinely could not sleep at night. I could barely breathe. You see the pain, and it was real pain. And Colleen [Schneider] had a full-on concussion. They didn’t show it, but she didn’t even remember being up on the hamster wheel.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 data-characters=283 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>Admitting that “It’s definitely not the way you want to go out,” both Michele and Olivia appear to be okay after filming came to a close, however, it is still unclear as to whether or not the latter had any additional surgery to repair this ruptured breast implant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, to find out for yourself <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who is crowned the winner of The Challenge: Battle for a New Champion</a>, catch the season 39 finale on Wednesday at 8pm ET/PT on MTV. It is sure to be nothing short of spectacular!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqedaaqmahnmLAsHnMrpqhZaCWtq951qGgnKBdqbWmecKhmKWklaO0pnnBmqutpJVis7C%2BjJpkp52nYrCprcypoKimXajBor6MrJycqpWpubp5z6inqZ2UYrWmvoybqZ6Zo6l6qrnPpZinrF2ku27Ax55krKCfrHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abena-ayivor-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Abena Ayivors biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
