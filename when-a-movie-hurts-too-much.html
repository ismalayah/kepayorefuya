<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>When a movie hurts too much | Roger Ebert</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>I inserted the DVD in the machine, pressed "play," and settled back to watch it. The first shot is a close-up of a man's face, a doctor, who tells someone she has advanced ovarian cancer. The next shot is a close-up of the woman he is speaking to, saying "yes?" or "and?" I forget which. I turned off the TV. I realized I actually could not watch the movie.</p><p>I remembered it too clearly, perhaps, and dreaded re-living it. When I reviewed it, its situation was theoretical for me, and I responded to the honesty and emotion of the drama. Since then, I have had cancer, and had all too many hours, days and weeks of hospital routine robbing me of my dignity. Although people in my situation are always praised for their courage, actually courage has nothing to do with it. There is no choice.</p><p>I used to smile at reader letters saying things like, "My husband is sick and I need a movie to cheer him up." I doubted the Norman Cousins theory that laughter is curative (I still do). The experience with "Wit" was a revelation. Yes, movies can be immediate and real to us--sometimes too real. Sometimes they record events we do not want to experience, or remember. It is a tribute to their power.</p><p>I have been watching a lot of <a href=#>Ingmar Bergman</a>. Last night I finished "The Passion of Anna" (1969). My original review is missing, but it was on my "best 10" list for the year, so I gave it full honor. Have you seen it? It is avant-garde in some of its devices, such as cutaways to the actors discussing their characters. Astonishingly well-photographed by <a href=#>Sven Nykvist</a>. Some of the best work ever done on screen by <a href=#>Liv Ullmann</a> and Max von Sydow, and <a href=#>Bibi Andersson</a>. And filled with deep, soul-lacerating anguish. But I could admire it, empathize with it, and not shrink away from it, because it was all happening to them. When it happens to you, that's another matter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq6eXmr9uscGeqa1np52yr3nAZqSorpmaeqnB0a2qZqyfpHquwcKh</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./100743-trevor-noah-shows-love-praises-fellow-comedians-chris-rock-dave-chapelle-html.html><span>←</span><span>Trevor Noah Shows Love and Praises Fellow Comedians Chris Rock and Dave Chapelle</span></a>
