As eldest son, Glen, Vincent D’Onofrio carries the burden of regret and responsibility on his beefy shoulders as a former baseball prodigy whose sports career hopes were dashed by an injury. As an unexpected MVP, D’Onofrio solemnly provides the perfect surefooted counterweight between the clash of the titans escalating between Downey and Duvall.</p><p>Then there is slow-witted youngest son Dale, played by <a href=#>Jeremy Strong</a>.&nbsp; His innocent questions often provide obtuse humor even if his near-childlike state goes unexplained. But too often&nbsp; Dale ends up being more of a device than a fully fleshed-out&nbsp; character as he shows new and old home movies shot on an vintage Super 8MM camera as a way of &nbsp;filling in the back story that haunts the Palmer clan.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Vera Farmiga</a>, whose local diner owner was cruelly dumped by Hank when they were in high school, seems almost part of a different movie. One by <a href=#>Frank Capra</a>. She primarily exists to provide a sympathetic ear for Downey and some undercooked romantic relief. In fact, a whole parade of colorful performers passes by, including <a href=#>Billy Bob Thornton</a> as a slim and steely silver fox of a prosecutor who battles Hank; <a href=#>Ken Howard</a> as the no-nonsense walrus-like judge presiding over Papa Palmer’s case; and <a href=#>Dax Shepard</a> as an unseasoned rube litigator.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, it is the core father-son relationship that is put on trial, and you have to wait until the end before Dobkin unclenches his need to control and just allows Downey and Duvall to fearlessly go at it together at full force.</p><p>Still, for almost every choice that rankles – using a raging tornado as a metaphor for the storm inside the Palmer homestead is so obvious, it hurts – there usually is something else that offers compensation. Probably my favorite scene, one that shows Dobkin still has it funny-wise: When Hank, looking to cherry-pick less than salt-of-the-earth types as potential jury members, decides to ask the candidates to reveal the bumper-sticker sayings on their cars. A woman with the word “Tolerance” spelled out with religious symbols gets a thumbs down. The guy whose saying is, “Wife and Dog Missing. Reward for Dog”? He gets a thumbs up. Way up. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lmqqxqLGMa2dqbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pok-c3-a9nav-plus.html><span>←</span><span>PokNav Plus - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
