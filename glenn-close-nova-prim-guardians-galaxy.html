This is another instance of James Gunn’s interesting spin on how these characters are going to be portrayed on screen and leads me to believe that they’re going to have to pull out all the stops if they are going to come anywhere close to&nbsp;the numbers that&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;achieved.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>This may well be one of the crucial role announcements <a href=#>teased</a> by James Gunn at Comic-Con, and is definitely a coup for the film – Glenn Close is a powerhouse actress and a bonafide star who would be unlikely to sully herself with a substandard property. If Glenn Close is on board they’ve either got a great script and a shedload of money, or a terrible script and a shedload of money, or drugs. Let’s hope it’s not the latter, because drugs are bad.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>Not that Glenn Close is by herself in terms of Hollywood megastars&nbsp;– she joins a cast that also counts amongst its number. To quote the aforementioned press release:</p><p>…Chris Pratt (“Zero Dark Thirty”, “Moneyball”) as Peter Quill aka Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana (“Star Trek Into Darkness”, “Avatar”) as Gamora, Dave Bautista (“Riddick”) as Drax the Destroyer, Lee Pace (“The Hobbit,” “Lincoln”) as Ronan the Accuser, Michael Rooker (AMC’s “The Walking Dead”) as Yondu, Karen Gillan (BBC TV’s “Doctor Who”) as Nebula, two-time Academy Award® nominee Djimon Hounsou (“Amistad”, “Gladiator”) as Korath, with Academy Award® winner Benicio del Toro (“Traffic”) as The Collector, Academy Award® nominee John C. Reilly (“Chicago”) as Rhomann Dey, and six-time Academy Award® nominee Glenn Close (“Albert Nobbs,” “Fatal Attraction”) as Nova Prime.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>With that capacity of high-wattage names, there is no way this film could fail, unless it’s secretly about Scientology.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=false><strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong> opens August 1st, 2014 in the US.
