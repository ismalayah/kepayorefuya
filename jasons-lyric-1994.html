<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Jason's Lyric movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1994)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Now years have passed, and Jason (<a href=#>Allen Payne</a>) has a good job at a TV store, while Joshua (<a href=#>Bokeem Woodbine</a>) has just been released from his latest prison term.</p><p>The two brothers love one another, but have come to live in different worlds. Joshua is quickly drawn into the orbit of Alonzo (Treach), the local gangster, while Jason falls instantly in love with Lyric (<a href=#>Jada Pinkett</a>), who walks into the store one day. She's hard to get. "If we're meant to meet again, we will," she says, and when he finds her behind the counter of a soul food restaurant, he follows her home and gives her a bouquet of roses, from which she deigns to select one, with a smile.</p><p>Lyric is Alonzo's sister. She also is best friends with his girl, Marti (Lisa Carson), the brash, buxom owner of the restaurant, who has sized up her world and decided Alonzo is the best she can do.</p><p>But when she sees the light in her girlfriend's eyes, she knows Lyric's found the real thing.</p><p>And she has. The love story in "Jason's Lyric" is a reminder of how rarely, these days, genuine warm romantic passion is seen on the screen. (I place the emphasis on "warm" and "romantic" to distinguish their relationship from the calisthenics, jousts and suppressed hostility in so many recent movies, where people make love as if they were being punished for their sins.) "Meet me when the sun leaves footprints across the sky," Lyric says, and she and Jason sit on an abandoned bridge, watching the sun set, and dreaming of getting on a bus and going - well, anywhere.</p><p>Anywhere to get out of the inexorably building tragedy in their lives, where Alonzo enlists Joshua in his gang for a bank robbery that these particular gang members are way too unstable to pull off. The movie develops two plot threads - the robbery, and the romance - and plays them against flashbacks to the tragedy of years ago. And we realize how rarely in the movies we really care about what's going to happen, and yet are in genuine suspense about what it will be.</p><p>The movie was directed by <a href=#>Doug </a><a href=#>McHenry</a> and produced by him and <a href=#>George Jackson</a>; their credits include "<a href=#>New Jack City</a>." Here they use Bobby Smith Jr.'s screenplay, with its richly drawn supporting characters, to paint a canvas that glows with life. The word "lyric" in the title is well used, because McHenry is not shy about lyrical touches, including a touching picnic in a grand old bus terminal, and a quotation from John Donne ("Come live with me and be my love") that is so right, we wonder why lovers never quote poetry to one another anymore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46jmKynnqh6rcXRoppmaWlugQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-to-know-the-star-wars-grand-admiral-how-to-read-the-thrawn-novels-in-order.html><span>←</span><span>Get to know the Star Wars Grand Admiral: How to read the Thrawn novels in order</span></a>
