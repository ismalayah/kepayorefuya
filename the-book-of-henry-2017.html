<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Book of Henry movie review (2017)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There are indicators that Henry has more on his mind than reminding his mother to open the mail and pay the bills. For one, he can see into the bedroom of Christina, the pretty yet ever more withdrawn mother-less ballerina next door (<a href=#>Maddie Ziegler</a> of Sia’s “Chandelier” video fame). He notices her stepdad (<a href=#>Dean Norris</a>), who just happens to be the police commissioner, regularly pays her visits at night and suspects she is being abused. Despite his calling the authorities, no one has checked out what is going on.</p><p>Then there are Henry’s lingering headaches, a condition that he has mostly kept to himself. That is a sure movie sign that someone is not going make it to the end credits. But Henry, as is his way, has left behind a carefully laid-out plan in a notebook and on tape for his mother to use to hunt down Christina’s stepfather if necessary. And, suddenly, “The Book of Henry” turns into a not very believable thriller, complete with a ticking clock and a talent show. Somehow, what turns out to be a nerve-wracking yet supposedly enlightening experience causes Susan to take more responsibility for her life and to face challenges head on. Plus, Henry’s cute doctor (<a href=#>Lee Pace</a>) has developed a crush on her. Nothing awkward about that.</p><p>For much of the film, I focused on the young actors (even Ziegler shows signs of having performing chops beyond her dance skills) and savored the few moments of dry humor—such as when Henry describes his own diagnosis in great detail and in complex medical terms to his shocked brain surgeon. But every book needs an editor, and there really is no upside in threatening to turn Watts into a mommy assassin. That doesn’t just make Henry look stupid, but his movie, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkqS8rHnOn2ShnZ6nxm5%2Bj2pu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./linda-hunts-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Linda Hunts Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
