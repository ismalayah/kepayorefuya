Opium I came across the Hondew/Opium issue by sheer chance. The Hondew is clearly purported as a honeydew, but it doesn't look like any kind melon; melons don't have spots. Ripe opium pods do have neat rows of blobs oozing out of them, and are green and upright like the Hondew berry image. They also have the effect of making the user 'weak but happy'.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why Do Fans Think Chandra Wilson Is Leaving Greys Anatomy?
