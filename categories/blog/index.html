This week’s episode of Peacemaker revealed some hitherto unexpected dimensions to the eponymous anti-hero — and an unexpected hidden talent of star John Cena. In what’s easily the most quietly moving scene of the show so far, one entirely dialogue-free sequence saw Cena’s Chris Smith take a moment to play Motley Crue’s “Home Sweet Home” on the piano.

A teenage romance between one of the Welton students and a local girl is given so little screen time, so arbitrarily, that it seems like a distraction. And I squirmed through the meetings of the "Dead Poets Society," a self-consciously bohemian group of students who hold secret meetings in the dead of night in a cave near the campus.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to get Adam Sandler presale tickets</h2><time>Sep 22, 2024</time>
