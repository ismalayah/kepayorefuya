Much to fans’ delight a reboot was said to be on the way back in 2019 over on Disney Plus. However, this has yet to materialize. Some time has passed but Duff is still optimistic that we haven’t seen the last of Lizzie yet.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>The series, which ran from 2001 to 2004 over on the Disney channel, followed awkward Lizzie as she figured out her teenage years, and even included a movie that saw Lizzie and her classmates on a trip to Rome, yes Spider-Man, Lizzie did it before you. Now Duff is all grown up, fans want to catch up with her and her animated inner voice, to see what the character has been getting up to.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=745 data-injectable=true>The revival was announced back in August of 2019, with both Duff and the original showrunner, Terri Minsky, set to return to their roles. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Many of the original cast</a> were also said to be on board and the show even started production in association with the Disney Channel, that is until Minsky departed from the project, putting the entire project on hiatus.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Another sticking point was that Duff wanted her character to reflect who she is now, a woman in her 30s, though apparently, Disney wanted to keep it a little more family-friendly than perhaps Duff had in mind. Seen as Lizzie McGuire’s fans are now all grown up, and the actress is all grown up, why not reflect that?</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Despite the long pause that the show has been put on, Duff appeared optimistic whilst talking to Andy Cohen on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch What Happens Live</a>. When asked if she would return to the role if Disney were to agree and if “it lived up to her vision” she answered, “of course.” She was very careful in her response to what had happened in order to put the revival on hold, carefully selecting her words she said,</p><p>“Disney+ was very new and I think they were figuring out their… and we were figuring out our… and I am optimistic.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Watch What Happens Live!

It’s always hard to admit when your kids are ready to fly the nest though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1qrjLmqmyZZSqs6d5xaKjpZ2UYsSqwMdmpqmsmaK2tLmMrZ%2BarF2Weq212bOgnmWdmLS2tdGeZKudkqS8tXnCqKylnF2XsqS7zJ5kmmWimq6ttdOyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clayton-english.html><span>←</span><span>Clayton English Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
