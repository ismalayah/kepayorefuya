<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>She's the Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2006)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Can Amanda Bynes convincingly play a boy? Of course not. She plays a cute tomboy with short hair who keeps forgetting to talk low and then nervously clears her throat and talks like she's on the phone to the school office: "Viola is sick today, and this is her mother speaking." Can she play soccer and live with a male roommate and take showers and not be exposed as a girl? Of course not, but at least the movie doesn't make a big deal out of it; she has a few close calls, and thinks fast. When the coach (<a href=#>Vinnie Jones</a>) announces a practice game between Shirts and Skins, she offers compelling reasons why she should be a Shirt.</p><p>Viola/Sebastian's roommate at Illyria is Duke, no doubt inspired by Duke Orsino in Shakespeare. But enough about Shakespeare. Duke seems attracted to Olivia (<a href=#>Laura Ramsey</a>), but Olivia is attracted to Sebastian/Viola, who gets a crush on Duke because he speaks with such sensitivity about women even when having a private conversation with her, or him. Duke is played <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a>, who sounds as if he should be the child of <a href=#>Carol Channing</a> and <a href=#>Tatum O'Neal</a>, which in this movie might be possible, although in real life he was born in Cullman, Ala.</p><p>Tatum is 26, a little old to play a high school kid, but Amanda Bynes at 19 is convincing, and her poise, under the circumstances, is extraordinary. The movie develops interlocking romantic triangles, and adds some funny supporting characters, including <a href=#>David Cross</a> as the headmaster, whose exuberance is as boundless as his baldness. Her mother, played by <a href=#>Julie Hagerty</a>, dreams of the day when her little girl will come out as a debutante; while being coached as a deb, Viola is advised to "chew like you have a secret." Does she ever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sn56rXam1pnnMmqVmamBlgw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maxmoefoe.html><span>←</span><span>Maxmoefoe- Bio, Wiki, Net Worth, Career Height, Weight, Girlfriend</span></a>
