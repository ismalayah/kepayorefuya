Before she topped the charts with songs like “I Kissed a Girl” and “California Gurls,” though, she spent the better part of a decade recording music under a different name. Perry’s album Teenage Dream, released in August 2010, boasted four chart-topping singles making it one of only nine albums to accomplish that feat in the Billboard Hot 100’s 52-year history. Katy Perry and Michael Jackson are the only two musicians in history to have five No. 1 singles from the same album. Katy Perry is undeniably one of the most popular American musician, songwriter, and singers today.</p><p>In 2011, she earned a total net worth of $44 million from endorsements, tours, merchandise and, album sales and earned $45 million in 2012. No stranger to business, she also makes her fortune from Perry shills for Proactiv, Adidas, and Ubisoft, and has her own perfume line, Purr. In addition, she has made numerous TV guest star appearances. She was born Katheryn Hudson on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, California. Perry had a long relationship with Travie McCoy. She eventually got married to British comedian and actor Russell Brand from 2010 to 2012. However, her 14-month marriage to the English comedian&nbsp;may have cost her $22 million as a divorce settlement since there was no prenuptial agreement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKORqcZuvMSrqbKrXZe2sLPRmqehsV2brqTAjJyYq52Vp3qiw8Crm6xlnprBbsPOq6uhZZyes6Z50q2mq7Ff</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-of-the-horror-movies-references-in-doja-cats-new-video-demons.html><span>←</span><span>All of the horror movies references in Doja Cats new video, Demons</span></a>
