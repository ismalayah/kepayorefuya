The reality show, known for its unrealistic dating premise, has beached a ton of chicks like they always do. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylee Russell</a> is one of them. She went there for one reason, as she revealed to viewers during her intro, and that was to date Aven.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>However, Aven wasn’t there, so she aimed for Will who was seeing Olivia. You got all that?<br>Problem is, Olivia and Kylee were allegedly friends, and Kylee knew that Olivia was there in hopes of seeing Will. Even so, Kylee crushed Olivia’s dreams and stole Will’s gullible heart. Will ditched Olivia, gave Kylee his rose so that she can stay on the beach, then got ditched by Kylee when — you guessed it — Aven showed up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Will shows interest in me and kisses me Kylee messes it up once she catches wind.</p><p>John Henry shows interest in me and we are together Kylee encourages Kat to mess it up.</p><p>Anyone else sensing a pattern?? <a href=#>#bachelorinparadise</a></p>— Liv Lew (@itslivlew) <a href=#>November 3, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Olivia temped Aven a bit but ultimately starting connecting with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Henry</a>. That’s when things get strange because Kat Izzo, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">self destructing for everyone to see</a>, suddenly needed to change her pursuits and decided to target John Henry while admitting she didn’t care that he was seeing Olivia. Kylee encouraged Kat to go for it. What a great friend that Kylee must be.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=76 data-injectable=false>So, Olivia took to social media and called out Kylee.
