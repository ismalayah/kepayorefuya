Here are lesser-known facts about Alyson Hannigan and her husband.</p><h2><strong>5 Things You Didn’t Know About Alyson Hannigan and Her Husband</strong></h2><h4><strong>1. Alyson Hannigan and her husband have no siblings</strong></h4><p>Alyson Hannigan is the only child of her parents, Alan Hannigan and Emilie Haas. She is of a mixed ethnicity comprising Irish from her father’s side and Russian from her mother’s who is also Jewish. She spent the first two years of her life with her parents in Santa Barbara, California before they divorced.</p><p>As for Alexis Denisof, the media has no record of his siblings. The actor is, however, yet to make it clear that he has none. Just like Hannigan, Denisof also possesses a mixed ethnicity of Irish and Russian alongside Jewish origins. He, however, has French roots in addition.</p><h4><strong>2. Alyson hit the screens at 4 while Alexis entered at 23</strong></h4><p>Despite being eight years younger, Alyson Hannigan (b. March 24, 1974) made her first screen appearance very much earlier than Alexis Denisof (b. February 25, 1966). Alyson precisely began featuring in television commercials such as Mylanta, Six Flags, and McDonald’s, Duncan Hines, and Oreos at the tender age of four. By the time she clocked eleven, Hannigan moved with her mother to Hollywood to broaden her chances in the field of acting. In Hollywood, Alyson combined her education with her budding career. She attended the North Hollywood High School while also auditioning for film roles. Alyson soon played her debut movie role on the 1986 film, <i>Impure Thoughts </i>after which she played a major role in <i>My Stepmother Is an Alien</i> (1988). On finishing from high school, she studied psychology at the California State University, Northridge before going into full-time acting.</p><p>Alexis Dennison on the other hand, made his first screen appearance on <i>Murder Story</i> (1989), at the age of 23. Before becoming an actor, Denisof attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art while also working. By the time he joined the industry, his future wife, Hannigan was already an established actress.</p><h4><strong>3. Alyson was the first to ask her husband out!</strong></h4><p>Alyson Hannigan met her future husband, Alexis Denisof on set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a supernatural drama television series that first aired in 1992. Hannigan was actually the first to make a move – she asked Denisof out. But guess what? Alexis turned down her request, saying he has a personal rule of not dating his workplace colleagues.</p><p>However, Alyson and Alexis eventually kicked off a romantic affair about a year and half after leaving the sets of Buffy; that was after they discovered that they truly care for each other. Their relationship which officially started in 1999 lasted until 2003 when they finally exchanged marital vows, precisely on the 11th of October. The long time love birds wedded in a colorful three-day ceremony held at the Two Bunch Palms Resort in DHS, California. Prior to this, Alexis had proposed to Alyson during a holiday trip to Northern California in 2002.</p><p>The couple now has two daughters – Satyana Marie and Keeva Jane. While Satyana was born on March 24, 2009, Keeva came around on May 23, 2012. The family of four lives in Encino, Los Angeles, California.</p><h4><strong>4. Hannigan and Denisof have a three-week rule</strong></h4><p>Asked in an interview for her greatest love advice, Alyson Hannigan revealed it’s never to stay apart for more than three weeks. Surprisingly, she pointed out that she and Denisof have never done so since after tying the knot, despite their work demanding schedule.</p><h4><strong>5. The couple are godparents of a celebrity child</strong></h4><p>While Alyson served as the godmother, Alexis played the godfather of Arden Cole, the son of popular American producer/writer and Buffy creator, Joss Whedon. Arden was born in 2002.</p><p>Alyson seems to have a special liking for kids. As a teenager, she helped comedian and actor Bob Saget with babysitting his children. According to the Buffy star, she places motherhood as her top priority.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaG1dqbWqusasZLKnpWKxqrDNrWSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZpmcrsCwuoyhmKemmZyur3nAp5tmoJWneqnB0puYp5xf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rapper-death-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Rapper 26Ceejay Shot Dead, Body Set to Fire in Florida</span></a>
