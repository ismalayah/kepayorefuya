Recommended Videos The ultra-rich rap artist originally from the Bronx who spoils herself and her family with lavish gifts has made a shocking confession on Twitter. OK, not really a shocking confession unless you consider how incredibly insensitive and out-of-touch it is. Hence why Cardi B’s post is blowing up today.
Cardi responded to a fan’s question on the bird app about her recent video with Latto for the song Put It On Da Floor Again, which just dropped 15 hours ago and already has over a million views on YouTube."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Some people expressed dislike for it since she is seen with her friends waving guns at the camera.

Thus, having fun with guns in her video in such a way doesn’t seem like the smartest idea.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>That fan on Twitter asked her why she’s posing with guns, and added, “Who escapes the hood just to relive it every chance they get?”</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Cardi B responded that she misses her old life and said, “Sometimes having everything GETS BORING,” though she was sure to add, “but I won’t complain.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>You wanna know wats so crazy ?

The first two are pretty harsh and unnecessary but, unfortunately, earned more likes than any other response.
