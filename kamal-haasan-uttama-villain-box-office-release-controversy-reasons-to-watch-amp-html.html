The presence of Ulaga Nayagan is not enough reason for you to book the tickets for this movie, then let us give you some more points on why you should be at the theatre for this flick.</p><p><strong>Why watch Kamal Haasan's Uttama Villain:</strong></p><p><strong>The actor:</strong> Kamal Haasan is touted to appear in different get-ups in the film. Kamal will be essaying the role of a superstar on screen in this flick. Not entirely, but a good part of Kamal’s life is portrayed in the movie.</p><figure class=story-figure>Kamal will be essaying the role of a superstar</figure><p><strong>The music:</strong> Music composer Ghibran and Kamal Haasan wanted the music to be creative and thus Kamal brought musical instruments from Bali, Indonesia, for recording a song in a mythical segment in the film as the instruments sounded both Indian and exotic. For the background music in the film, traditional tunes were mixed with orchestral symphony backgrounds and are fused with Villupattu and Theyyam. Kamal Hassan has sung a few songs in the movie as well, which makes it something to look forward to.</p><figure class=story-figure>Uttama Villain's music has a rare album which doesn't merely push the envelope but has managed to create a new, different envelope</figure><p><strong>The Malayali presence:</strong> There are five malayali faces associated with the movie including — Jayaram, Urvashi, Parvathi Menon and Shamdat who is the director of photography and editor Vijay. While Jayaram will be playing a serious role, Urvashi will make us laugh and cry at the same time. Parvathi became popular in Tamil Nadu through Mariyan and in Uttama Villain she is playing Kamal’s daughter.</p><figure class=story-figure>Each of the Malayalis have performed extremely well and contributed to the movie</figure><p><strong>The plot:</strong> Kamal Haasan, who is also known for his brilliant screenplays is credited with the screenplay of Uttama Villain and it would be completely riveting. Initially, Kamal had stated that the flick is not a full-length comedy and is a social drama in which a musical is set. The movie within a movie will see two time periods.</p><figure class=story-figure>The flick is a social drama with a musical</figure><p><strong>The director:</strong> Ramesh Arvind is not only a director but also a famous actor in Kannada and Telugu movies. More than an actor-director relationship, Kamal and Ramesh share a very good friendship. Moreover, Uttama Villain is Kamal Haasan’s guru director-producer-actor K. Balachnder’s last film.</p><figure class=story-figure>Director Ramesh(L) with K Balachander and Kamal Haasan</figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyr8DEq6uaoZ6isq%2FAjKecsKtfoK6urctmn5qZo5a7bsHTrZimmV2rtq24wKKlZpqfrXqwssWimp5lopq5pq3SnmScp56pv7DCxKuqsmWimq60u82sZK2nXayuta%2FHZ5imqF6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./writer-james-pattersons-probe-into-the-behaviour-of-neighbour-jeffrey-epstein.html><span>←</span><span>Writer James Patterson's probe into the behaviour of neighbour Jeffrey Epstein</span></a>
