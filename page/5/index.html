With so many bulging biceps, beefy bros, and massive egos on set at any given time, the Fast & Furious franchise was always destined to suffer from at least a little bit of behind the scenes drama, but recent comments from Jason Momoa could lend weight to the theory that Dwayne Johnson may have been the problem all along.

Recommended Videos Hence why in 1987, Hamill introduced Beatles cartoons to a new generation thanks to MTV. At the time, MTV actually showed music videos and music-related shows (shocking, I know), so airing Beatles cartoons still made sense for the network.
