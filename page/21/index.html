Seattle Storm player Breanna Stewart is officially on the road to the altar! In a recent post on her Instagram page, the WNBA star announced that she and her girlfriend Marta Xargay Casademont are engaged. She wrote:

Taylor Swift and boyfriend of six or so years Joe Alwyn continue to seem like they really like each other, and meanwhile, she’s managed to continue churning out devastating songs with no end in sight. This should be a satisfactory arrangement for all involved, and yet, engagement speculation for the couple is so persistent that it’s news when Swift does not wear an engagement ring that we have no proof ever existed.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Those Resident Evil 4 VR Censorship Rumors Are Now Confirmed</h2><time>Jul 16, 2024</time>

Resident Evil 4 VR&nbsp;should have been an easy win. It’s one of the finest entries in the series and a great candidate for VR, particularly as the&nbsp;franchise already nailed it in Resident Evil 7.

Although America is the last market to play “Bean,” the film seems to have been tailored with an eye to Yank viewers; most of the action takes place in Los Angeles. The set-up is in London, where Bean is employed as a guard at an art gallery and is “easily our worst employee,” as the curator says at a board meeting where the first order of business is to fire him.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Game of Death movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2020)</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>

I’d like to tell you that “Game of Death” picks up after a few tentative murders, but that’s not really true.
