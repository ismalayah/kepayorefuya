Thanks to an impressive performance as the title character in Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis, actor Austin Butler is having a moment that includes winning the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Motion Picture and being a front-runner for an Oscar. He opened up in a recent interview about his artistic journey before Elvis and revealed how he approached fluffier parts with an attitude of greatness. He was even inspired by a hit classic movie.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How much is Pedro Pascal paid for The Mandalorian?</h2><time>Jun 22, 2024</time>

The Mandalorian is back for a third season, and returning is the series’ star, Pedro Pascal, reprising his role as Din Djarin. The show’s third season was met with a lot of hype due to Mando’s and Grogu’s reunion in The Book of Boba Fett last year and the actor’s ongoing rise to popularity thanks to HBO’s The Last of Us.

Almost everyone on the boat is a Swedish laborer, looking for work. Farmers have turned out to inspect them as if they were cattle.
One by one, the men are hired, until finally only Lasse and Pelle are left. Nobody wants to hire Lasse (Max von Sydow). He is too old. He has a son. Half-drunk and defiant, he all but forces himself on the last of the farmers, a man named Kongstrup who has a shifty look about him.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Taylor Hatala- Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Career, Nationality</h2><time>Jun 22, 2024</time>

While I never saw the original version, I found myself impressed more by the look of the director’s cut than its actual substance. Gomez-Rejon’s film moves in spry, elegant fashion with some striking imagery and showy camera movements (the work of Park Chan-wook’s usual cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon, who also shot Gomez-Rejon’s 2015 YA drama “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl”). Long tracking shots and lush luminescence provide both a sense of intimacy and possibility.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The most overrated Pokemon | Bulbagarden</h2><time>Jun 22, 2024</time>

I don't think there are many Pokemon that fit the definition of overrated. There's a difference between something being overused and overrated. A Pokemon being trendy will only get it so far before its flaws start to become apparent, so there aren't too many OU Pokemon I think fit the label. That said, one Pokemon I think fits (or used to fit, going off what I said above) the definition is Galvantula.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Maxxine Dupris Boyfriend Getting WWE Tryout Before SummerSlam</h2><time>Jun 21, 2024</time>

<a href=../../whered-you-go-bernadette-2019.html></a>
Based on Maria Semple’s book of the same title, the movie version of “Where’d You Go, Bernadette” shifts the perspective of the story from Bee’s search for her runaway mom onto Bernadette’s shoulders. However, this character is not interested in making it easy for the audience to empathize with her. Linklater can’t seem to strike the right tone for Bernadette’s story, so in some moments, she’s comically ill-equipped to handle the slightest of domestic chores and foists a number of her personal tasks on an unseen digital assistant based in India.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>One Piece fans react to King and Zoros battle in chapter 1036</h2><time>Jun 20, 2024</time>
