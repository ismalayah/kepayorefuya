In the interview, the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Legally Blonde&nbsp;star </a>shared that during her waitressing days, she found herself attracted to “angry chefs” while disclosing the number of restaurant jobs she’s had.</p><p>“99% of my jobs were restaurant jobs. I was a waitress, and I always fell in love with the angry chefs.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Further into the conversation, when White asked Coolidge why she was attracted to male chefs, the star explained it was because she found it incredibly “sexy” how they threw “the food down” and commanded her to take the order. Coolidge would go on to add that another reason she was smitten with chefs was due to their abilities to accomplish a task “fast,” which she described caused her to feel inferior at times.</p><p>“I just like the way they throw the food down… I don’t know it was so sexy… The other thing is the chefs really did have a whole system and they work fast. I would come up and I’ll be so discombobulated and go like ‘Which one is this?’ They’ll be like ‘take it, this is the one. Just take it, this is the one.'”</p><p>“There’s something about a man that can do something fast. I felt inferior and they can make all this food come out and is just like, ‘just take it.’ I was just like, ‘oh my god.’ Just one moment of that, I just be like, ‘You are the one for me.'”</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Towards the end of Coolidge’s remarks on her attractiveness to chefs, the actress was asked if she pursued any romantic relationships with her past co-workers. The&nbsp;Shotgun Wedding&nbsp;star admitted that “there were a lot of chefs” in her life and revealed that chefs’ “hostile” persona in restaurants also comes up in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p><p>“Yes, there were a lot of chefs in my life. I would have to say when you see that hostile tough person in the kitchen, it does transfer to real life when it’s out of the restaurant.”</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false><br>Despite that factor, Coolidge went on to praise chefs for the amount of work they have to do to maintain good service and a restaurant’s clientele.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>For more on Coolidge and White’s&nbsp;Actors to Actors&nbsp;interview, check out Variety‘s YouTube page.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3prrNop2eql2YvLC4yJ2enmWUnrGvwIynnJ6cXam8br7Er5yapF2dsrN5yqKlpKtdqbxuwdJmq6icka56o8HTZqqhnV2owrOxjJ2gnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./warren-chow-age-and-ethnicity-explored-meet-the-cast-from-superman-and-lois-234488-html.html><span>←</span><span>Warren Chow Age And Ethnicity Explored- Meet The Cast From Superman And Lois</span></a>
