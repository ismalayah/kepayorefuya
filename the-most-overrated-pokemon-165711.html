A Pokemon being trendy will only get it so far before its flaws start to become apparent, so there aren't too many OU Pokemon I think fit the label.<p>That said, one Pokemon I think fits (or used to fit, going off what I said above) the definition is Galvantula. When Sticky Web was a new thing, it was really popular. I bred and used one myself and I couldn't believe how disappointed I was with its performance. Its biggest flaw is that has no staying power; to me the best entry hazard users are the ones who can find opportunities to force switches or have otherwise good defenses so you can guarantee you will be able to set and reset hazards as needed.</p><p>Smeargle and Shuckle have always been the superior Sticky Web users because of this, and others seem to have caught on since their usage has risen lately in comparison with Galvantula, which is now no longer OU. Being able to deal with most Defog users is nice, but to me its not enough of a niche to choose Galvantula over Smeargle (I don't have a ton of experience using Shuckle).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1tMRmpKirpGK8t7HRq5itnZRivbC3xKamp2Zha4J4fZBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-current-war-movie-review-2019.html><span>←</span><span>The Current War movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</span></a>
