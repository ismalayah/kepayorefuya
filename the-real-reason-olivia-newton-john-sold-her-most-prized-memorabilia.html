She wanted to raise money to continue the fight against breast cancer. A portion of the proceeds went towards the singer's own organization, the <a href=#>Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre</a> in Australia. The organization, which was <a href=#>created in 2012</a>, is dedicated to providing care to other breast cancer patients.</p><p dir=ltr>The singer admitted that it was easy for her to let go of these items at this stage of her life. She valued the memories behind the items more than the items themselves. "That's one of the things I've learned on this journey of mine, is that stuff isn't important, it's people and the relationships you have," the singer shared (via <a href=#>Yahoo!</a>). She also admitted that she had photos of every item so she could look back on them whenever she was feeling nostalgic.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, the auction raised a whopping total of $2.4 million! With that larger purpose in mind, an anonymous billionaire even bought Newton-John's iconic leather jacket from "Grease" and returned it to her. That money still went towards her organization, which will continue to serve patients battling the disease. In life, Olivia Newton-John was committed to others besides herself, and, through her research center, she will continue to touch the lives of others, even in death.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm1nZYF5e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2kuarCyJpkp52nqbyvecmon6dlo6S5pXnHnqlmpZ%2BowW680aKxnpxdorKuu9GamaKkmZZ8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ahn-bo-hyun.html><span>←</span><span>South Korean Actor, Ahn Bo-Hyun is living a single life (Bio, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Parents &amp;amp; Net</span></a>
