Instead of following the rise of an actual sports star, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Air </a></strong>will instead track the rise of Nike, and how the company managed to score professional basketballer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Jordan</a> in 1984 before he was even drafted into the NBA. What is interesting about the movie is that it follows Nike rather than following the Chicago Bulls star.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>You might want to know more about the upcoming film, including its cast, and release date, so let’s take a look at everything you need to know about Air.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-everything-you-need-to-know-about-air data-injectable=false>Everything you need to know about ‘Air’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>The film was written by Alex Convery and was directed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Affleck</a>, who also directed Argo and The Town. In addition to directing the film, Affleck also stars as Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike, Inc. Air is set to release on April 5, 2023. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Damon</a> is the star of the movie, as he plays Sonny Vaccaro, the executive who was responsible for signing Michael Jordan to the company. You can watch the trailer for Air above.</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=98 data-injectable=false>In addition to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Affleck and Damon</a>, the film also stars the following actors in the following roles.</p><ul data-items-injection=true data-current-count=715.5 data-injectable=true><li>Jason Bateman as Rob Strasser</li><li>Chris Messina as David Falk</li><li>Marlon Wayans as George Raveling</li><li>Chris Tucker as Howard White</li><li>Viola Davis as Deloris Jordan</li><li data-injectable=true>Matthew Maher as Peter Moore</li><li>Tom Papa as Stu Inman</li><li>Julius Tennon as James R.

Strasser, Falk, Raveling, and White are all people involved with either Jordan or Nike, while Viola Davis and Julius Tennon have been cast as MJ’s parents.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Matt-Damon-in-Air.jpg><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>As for Michael Jordan’s involvement in the film, well while his parents have been cast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he has not</a>. He will instead be appearing in archive footage. The reason he won’t be in the film is that this is not a Michael Jordan movie. Sure, Michael Jordan’s exploding popularity after the 1984 Olympics might be one of the reasons Nike ended up succeeding in their venture, but the story of what happened after they signed Jordan is not the story being told in Air.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Instead, this will be a tale of a different court. It is about how the executives at Nike managed to make a deal that ended up making the company over a billion dollars. Catch Air when it lands in theaters on April 5, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKKqXZi8tr7ToqWgZZFiuaazxKebZpuRqMFuvsSlnJqrlWKxosDEZqurmZmhsrN5wKebZqWZmLWisctmoaiqlJa7tHnIp62opKaauqa602g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-doja-cat-dating-2022-know-doja-cat-dating-history-and-more-465489-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Doja Cat Dating 2022?
