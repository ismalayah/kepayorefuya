<a href=../../../leap-of-faith-1992.html></a>
Steve Martin stars, as a preacher who has conned so many people in so many ways that he hardly knows when he's conning himself. As the movie opens, one of the trucks breaks down with engine trouble, and they pull off into a Southwestern backwater to throw a few unscheduled shows until replacement parts arrive. It seems like an ordinary enough town. He doesn't realize it's his personal crossroads.
The role is an unusual one for Martin, who plays it straight (this is not a comedy) and yet satirizes the character at the same time.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Upcoming Idle Hands Blu-Ray To Get New Cast Commentary And More</h2><time>May 7, 2024</time>

Scream Factory recently announced that they’re putting out a new Blu-ray of cult 1990s horror comedy&nbsp;Idle Hands.&nbsp;Although not a commercial success on its theatrical release,&nbsp;Idle Hands has since built up a strong enough fanbase to justify the deluxe treatment from Scream Factory, who have now revealed that the collector’s edition will be packed with new features. Perhaps most excitingly, we’ll get a brand new cast commentary with Devon Sawa, Seth Green, Elden Henson, and Vivica A.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What is James Gunns net worth now that hes co-CEO of DC Studios?</h2><time>May 7, 2024</time>

The celebrated director behind the Guardians of the Galaxy films is making the switch from Marvel to DC.
Recommended Videos He’s not completely departing the MCU — in wonderful news for fans of his work on the Guardians films — but James Gunn was recently announced as the co-CEO of DC Studios. He and Peter Safran&nbsp;impressed Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav so much, as advisors, that he bumped them up a few dozen positions.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brd Brennan movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>May 6, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../glenn-close-nova-prim-guardians-galaxy.html></a>
Recommended Videos Marvel have confirmed the start of production on Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;and that Glenn Close has officially been cast as Nova Prime, a character usually seen as a male. This is another instance of James Gunn’s interesting spin on how these characters are going to be portrayed on screen and leads me to believe that they’re going to have to pull out all the stops if they are going to come anywhere close to&nbsp;the numbers that&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;achieved.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>TLC: Who Is Producer Chris Cardamone?
